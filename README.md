    k-Means clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm that seeks to segment a dataset into groups based on the similarity of datapoints. An unsupervised model has independent variables and no dependent variables. In this project, I break down the basic idea of it, just simple to understand how it works.

## Tech Stack

* **Python:** Version 3.10

* **NumPy:** Version 1.23.0

* **Scipy**: Version 1.9.1

* **Matplotlib**: Version 3.5.3 

* **Spyder IDE**: Version 5.3.2

## Details

* I implemented here an algorithm from scratch to apply clustring to some dataset. There are 2 main points we need to know.

* First, choosing some random points to start with it as initial centroids, pick any 3 centroids from the dataset.

* Second, find the nearest centroid for every point, then assign it to it's centroid.

* Then, we try to centralize the new centroids by finding the shortest path between all of them.

* Finally, Repeat!
